If I reduce the screen to a sort of tablet browser width, the image layout looks clunky. If I have time, I'd like to scale the size of the three images so they always sit in a row for tablet sized screens...

I'm pleased with the Newsletter banner after Alan asked me questions and gave me advice that helped me solve it. I will add margins and whatnot later. The cramorant sprite looks like a sticker here. My idea would be to have the artist draw their own graphics to add to some of the white space. I'm so happy that I actually managed to change the outline colour for the email input and subscribe button.

Right. Time to stop fussing about the homepage. Tackle the contact page.

It's been a while. So with 3 days left, I'm going to be realistic with my time. I was going to have a go at creating a mock-shop, I've decided to direct link to printcapsuo's etsy. Today I'll tackle the contact form & about. Saturday I'll make the art gallery page. Then send it away.

Later on 05 May 2022:
I didn't get to the contact form... Will do it on Saturday.

Removed contact page, wanted to try a link on the same page. Also means if someone is scrolling, they'll see the contact form at the bottom of the home page.
