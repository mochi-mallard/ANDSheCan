If I reduce the screen to a sort of tablet browser width, the image layout looks clunky. If I have time, I'd like to scale the size of the three images so they always sit in a row for tablet sized screens...

I'm pleased with the Newsletter banner after Alan asked me questions and gave me advice that helped me solve it. I will add margins and whatnot later. The cramorant sprite looks like a sticker here. My idea would be to have the artist draw their own graphics to add to some of the white space. I'm so happy that I actually managed to change the outline colour for the email input and subscribe button.

Right. Time to stop fussing about the homepage. Tackle the contact page.

It's been a while. So with 3 days left, I'm going to be realistic with my time. I was going to have a go at creating a mock-shop, I've decided to direct link to printcapsuo's etsy. Today I'll tackle the contact form & about. Saturday I'll make the art gallery page. Then send it away.

Later on 05 May 2022:
I didn't get to the contact form... Will do it on Saturday.

Removed contact page, wanted to try a link on the same page. Also means if someone is scrolling, they'll see the contact form at the bottom of the home page.

Lots done today. The flexbox and responsiveness of About page was hard and I got it in the end! It's looking good. Mistake I made early on was trying to set the height:auto; and width:100% for a div. Forgot it was for images. Read stackoverflow forum and realised why my image kept disappearing. Had a go at a media query on the About page too! If I have time, I'll do the same for the homepage.

Also sorted out my contact form, really happy with how those form fields turned out. So cool how I could change the colour of the outlines on focus.

Added a "Back to top" link on the homepage.

For a looong time, I couldn't figure out why I couldn't get the "upcoming events" info to scale with the browser getting smaller... It was because of "white-space: nowrap;".

Home images are a bit off-centre and not aligned precisely. I'm happy that they can scale with the browser changing size though :') Having fun with media queries today!

Good god, learned how to get the images to zoom in on hover. This is seriously cool. Add a card in Notion.

I feel grateful for this AND bootcamp. I think it gave me a push to get on with this because of the project submission.
I feel proud of what I've done, I could add so much more--links to the gallery, more media query stuff. For now. I'm happy with it. Time to submit this.
